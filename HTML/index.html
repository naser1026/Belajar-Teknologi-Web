        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p><b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or HTML is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language"> markup language </a>for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as <i> JavaScript</i>.</p>
        <p>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>In 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist">physicist</a> Tim Berners-Lee , a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.<sup>[3]</sup> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry</p>
