    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p><b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or HTML is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language"> markup language </a>for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as <i> JavaScript</i>.</p>
    <p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
